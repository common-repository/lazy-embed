Improves the performance and reduces the emissions of your website by only loading embeds (youtube, vimeo, etc) when they are clicked.

== Description ==

Videos are one of the largest assets that can be loaded on a webpage, and as such are one of the largest contributors to slow performance and high carbon emissions.

In fact, adding a Youtube embed to a page using the latest default WordPress theme, increased the page transfer size from 21 kb to 973 kb, and loaded an additional 27 resources. Thatâ€™s an increase in transfer size of 4533%. Adding a Vimeo video increased the transfer from 21 kb to 276 kb, an increase in transfer size of 1214%, and loaded an additional 7 resources.

The Lazy Embed plugin defers the loading of any resource required for playing the video until the video is requested to be played. It does this by adding a srcdoc attribute to the iframe which shows in place of the normal iframe content.

Currently the following third parties are supported

* Youtube
* Vimeo
* Dailymotion

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are there any settings =
Nope, install the plugin and you are good to go. There are some filters available for modifying the behaviour though.

= Can I stop the plugin from modifying an iframe = 
Yes you can, add the "lazy-embed-ignore" class to the iframe itself or using the gutenberg editor

= Why do I have to click a video twice somtimes for it to play? =
Browsers have become more restrictive around autoplaying a video. The first click on a video never reaches the video host, so they then show the default thumbnail. After the first time a Lazy Embed is interacted with, subsequent videos from that provider will not require a second load.

= I have updated the thumbnail for my video in Youtube/Vimeo/Dailymotion. Why am I not seeing the updated thumbnail? =
The thumbnails are cached to improve the performance (uncached frontend pages) and reduce the emissions (less requests to the video platform) of the Lazy Embed plugin.

The cache is known as transients. You can clear the transient cache using a plugin like [WP-Sweep](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-sweep/)

= Why does it not work for my videos? =
It could be for one of a few reasons.

1. A thumbnail for the embed could not be retrieved. If this is the case, send us a message with the video and we will take a look
